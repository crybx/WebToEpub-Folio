# WebToEpub-Folio

A variant of [WebToEpub](https://github.com/dteviot/WebToEpub) with
additional features, UI enhancements, and theming options.

## About

WebToEpub-Folio builds on the original WebToEpub extension,
which converts web novels and stories to epub format with support
for numerous websites and parsers.

WebToEpub-Folio adds:

- Enhanced responsive UI layouts
- Additional themes and customization options
- Improved visual design elements
- A chapter viewer that allows reading downloaded chapters
- Chapter caching to avoid unnecessary redownloading
- Deeper library feature integration
    - Automatic "Library Mode" for viewing a story that is a current library book
    - Read chapters from library books with the chapter viewer
    - More options to edit library books
        - Delete and re-order chapters
        - Add targeted chapters
        - Refresh targeted chapters from source
    - Treat library books as a cache tier for individual chapters

This fork explores alternative approaches to user interface and user experience
while maintaining compatibility with WebToEpub's core functionality.
